## Virtual Environment Projects

Collection of VR projects made in Unity. Scripts are written in C#, shaders in CG, and all models are made in Blender. Made for VIS 143 course. 

There are 3 main projects. Teddy Bear Interrogation was the introductory project, getting familiar with the VRTK package. Altering Space experiments with the use of a grappling hook as a means of locomotion, and ways to subvert perception when scaling objects in VR. Masked Reality experiments with the concept of layering virtual spaces using a stencil shader effect, while also being a puzzle minigame.
