VR application  made to aid user's 3D spatial visualization. For research with [Jurgen Schulze](http://web.eng.ucsd.edu/~jschulze/) and Karen Lucknavalai.

I worked on the procedural algorithms to generate the puzzles shown below, and helped with integrating the PhysX library with the in-house VR framework.
