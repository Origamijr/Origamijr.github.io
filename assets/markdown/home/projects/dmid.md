## Deep Music Information Dynamics

Research with [Shlomo Dubnov](http://dub.ucsd.edu/), Ke Chen, and Cheng-iÂ Wang investigating Deep Musix Information Dynamics, a novel framework for investigating the information content of music through the information bottleneck of a neural network. My role was to develop and run the experiments involving audio. Paper accepted to JCMS.
