## Pd Soft Synth + Sequencer

This is an accumulation of components made for MUS 172 course on computer music. Capabilities include:

* Wavetable synthesizer from midi input
* Audio file sequencer
* Panning and reverb effects
* Recording all actions to file and playback of actions from file
* Built-in sample performance, which is my arrangement of a vocaloid medley (Strobe Light by powapowap, ODDS & ENDS by supercell, and I'm Glad You're Evil Too by pinocchiop)
