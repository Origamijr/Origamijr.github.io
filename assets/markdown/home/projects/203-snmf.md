## Sparse NMF Source Separation

Study on the effectiveness of sparsity terms for nonnegative matrix factorization. Our group investigated the question of the effectiveness of soft sparsity constraints in order to deduce the number of sources in an unmixing problem. I created the base experiments, calculated the sparsity terms, and ran the tests in the context of audio blind source separation. Done for CSE 203 (convex optimization) final project.
