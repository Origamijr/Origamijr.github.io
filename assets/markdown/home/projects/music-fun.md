Small experimental python environment playing with real-time midi/audio analysis/interraction. Main framework consists of wxPython for windowing and GUI, OpenGL for graphics library, and pyo for DSP. Current capabilities include:

* Midi file loading, display, and playback
* Real-time waveform/spectrogram from microphone

Planned to include:

* Midi analysis using ML algorithms (eg. HMM chord detection, etc)
* Audio analysis (SSM, annotation, etc)
* Real-time improvisation algorithm
* and more
