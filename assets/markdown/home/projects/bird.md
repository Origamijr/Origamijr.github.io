## Bird

Bird simulator in VR for HTC Vive, created in a group of 4, made for HackXR Hackathon in 2018. Won Best Medical Hack for requiring the user to exert a lot of physical energy.

I worked on all of the C# scripts inside of the project, and also made sure that everything fit together when placed in Unity.
