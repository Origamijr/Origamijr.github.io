## Introduction

Hi. Welcome to my site. Forgive the poor design as I am quite a novice at web development.

My name is Kevin Huang. I am currently working on a PhD in Electrical Engineering at University of Southern California. I've obtained a Masters (2021) and a Bachelors (2020) in Computer Science at UCSD. I have a particular interest in **Machine Learning** as it applies to audio processing (analysis and synthesis) in the domains of music and speech. I also have some interest in Computer Graphics on the side (particularly real-time graphics, animation, and virtual reality).

Asides from programming, I enjoy playing piano and playing games. Although I am classically trained, taking piano lessons since elementary school, I more often than not tend to play anime song covers on piano. As for games, I mainly play gacha games, rhythm games, minesweeper, or whatever my friends are playing at the time.

I, uh, haven't figured out how to make this website work on mobile. Maybe I'll figure out this summer.
