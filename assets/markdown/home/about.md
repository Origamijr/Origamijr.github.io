## Introduction

Hi. Welcome to my primitive site. Forgive the poor design as I am a novice at web development. As I learn more about Angular, HTML, and CSS, I will try to apply my knowledge here.

My name is Kevin Huang. I am currently studying computer science as an undergrad at UCSD. While I'm clearly not deep into web dev, I have a particular interest in computer graphics and artificial intelligence.

Asides from programming, I am also particularly fond of music. When I'm not programming, I will likely be playing piano or a rhythm game of some variety. I never try to keep my interest in music separate from my work with computers. You will find that many of my recent projects will attempt to work in the intersection between computer science and music.


Everything below here is just my rambling.


## Website Notes

Originally, the project name for this site was "Communist Manifesto Desu". I have been notified by my mother that it probably wasn't the best naming choice. As such, I renamed the repository to "Capitalist Manifesto Desu" (still political, but at least my mother doesn't mind), but there might still be some artifacts left over.
