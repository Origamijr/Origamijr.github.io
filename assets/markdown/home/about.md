## Introduction

Hi. Welcome to my primitive site. Forgive the poor design as I am a novice at web development. Regardless, I am a big fan of the DIY mentality, so I thought I'd have a go at building from scratch (using Angular as a framework). As I learn more about Angular, HTML, and CSS, I will try to apply my knowledge here.

My name is Kevin Huang. I am currently studying computer science as an undergrad at UCSD. While I'm clearly not deep into web dev, I have a particular interest in **Computer Music** (MIR and generation), **Computer Graphics** (particularly games and VR), and **Artificial Intelligence** (mostly NLP).

Asides from programming, I am also particularly fond of music. When I'm not programming, I will likely be playing piano or a rhythm game of some variety. I never try to keep my interest in music separate from my work with computers. You will find that many of my recent projects will attempt to work in the intersection between computer science and music.


Everything below here is just my rambling.


## Website Notes

You may have noticed that there's a random orange ball bouncing on the page. That was an experiment on creating interractable graphics with css and javascript. You can grab the ball and throw it, but that's pretty much it. I might eventually expand on this concept.

Originally, the project name for this site was "Communist Manifesto Desu". I have been notified by my mother that it probably wasn't the best naming choice. As such, I renamed the repository to "Capitalist Manifesto Desu" (still political, but at least my mother doesn't mind), but there might still be some artifacts left over.
