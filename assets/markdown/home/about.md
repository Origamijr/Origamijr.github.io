## Introduction

Hi. Welcome to my site. Forgive the poor design as I am quite a novice at web development. Regardless, I am a big fan of the DIY mentality, so I thought I'd have a go at building from scratch (using Angular as a framework).

My name is Kevin Huang. I recently graduated with a Masters in computer science from UCSD. As web development is clearly not my strong suit, I have a particular interest in **Machine Learning** as it applies to audio processing (analysis and synthesis) in the domains of music and speech. I also have some interest in Nautral Language Processing and Computer Graphics (particularly real-time graphics, animation, and virtual reality).

Asides from programming, I am also particularly fond of music. When I'm not programming, I will likely be playing piano or a rhythm game of some variety. I never try to keep my interest in music separate from my work with computers. You will find that many of my recent projects will attempt to work in the intersection between computer science and music.
